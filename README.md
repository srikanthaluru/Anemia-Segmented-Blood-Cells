# Blood samples for Image Processing and Machine Learning (Iron-deficient blood slide images)
I have taken over 60 images of 10 different iron-deficient blood slides myself by using Olympus CH40RF200 microscope equipped with a Sony Full HD 1080 digital camera with an effective magnification of 100.
The blood samples are taken from the Department of Medical Sciences of University of Isfahan, Iran and Sayed-Al-Shohada Hospital located at Isfahan, Iran.

This dataset can be used for machine learning and image processing purposes and is free to all researchers. I would appreciate it if you could mention the details of the dataset and cite my relevant paper (mentioned below) if you use my dataset in your studies. 
My relevant paper is:
